# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard


##  Using a weather dashboard to book your next trip
 On this interactive webpage, the User will be able to retrieve weather conditions of the city of interest. The third party API, [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) was used to retrieve current and future weather conditions for the cities. In addition, the cities that were searched are stored in the local server so that the User can see the search history when returning to the webpage.


## Usage 

1) Open the index.html file with Chrome/Firefox web browsers:
2) Type in the city that you're interested for weather conditions. Then click on the "Search" button. See [How To Use Demo](HowToUse.PNG). 
3) Current weather conditions will appear at the top of the page, alongside the 5-day forecast of the city.
4) A list containing the history of cities that was searched is presented on the page.
